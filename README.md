# CMT316-Coursework-1-Part-2
A repository containing all pieces of work for the CMT316: Applications of Machine Learning: Natural Language Processing/Computer Vision

Step 1: Download the bbc dataset

Step 2: Import any modules that you have not already imported by either installing
them using whatever IDE you're using or by installing them on Windows PowerShell using
the following command:
py -m pip install module_name

Step 3: Make sure the bbcBusinessFile, bbcEntertainmentFile, bbcPoliticsFile
bbcSportFile, and bbcTechFile variables contain the correct path for each 
folder. For example bbcBusinessFile should contain the path for the business 
folder, bbcEntertainmentFile should contain the path for the entertainment
folder etc. If you get the unicode error make sure that you place a lowercase
'r' in front of the file path. For example... 

bbcBusinessFile = "C:\Users\jacob\OneDrive\Desktop\CMT Assignment Part 2\bbc\business"
should look like this...

bbcBusinessFile = r"C:\Users\jacob\OneDrive\Desktop\CMT Assignment Part 2\bbc\business"
with an 'r' infront of the quotation marks.

Step 4: run the code and wait for the results.
